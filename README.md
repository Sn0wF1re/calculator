# Calculator Project


    - The calculator is going to contain functions for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators:
        add
        subtract
        multiply
        divide


    - A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number. For example, 3 + 5. 


    - **Some Gotchas:**
        - Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = should yield 42.

        - The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation, along with the next operator (-).

        - Answers with long decimals are rounded so that they don’t overflow the screen.

        - Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!

        - Pressing “clear” wipes out any existing data..

        - A snarky error message will be displayed if the user tries to divide by 0.
